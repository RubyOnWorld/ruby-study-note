ss001: nested def keyword
-------------------------

	# small snippet 001
	class Dog
	  def say
	    def cry
	      def bark
	        puts 'Wooo!'
	      end
	    end
	  end
	end
	
	d = Dog.new
	p Dog.instance_methods(false)  #=> ["say"]
	d.say
	p Dog.instance_methods(false)  #=> ["say", "cry"]
	d.cry
	p Dog.instance_methods(false)  #=> ["say", "bark", "cry"]
	d.bark  #=> Wooo!


The method is actually created dinamically.
The method `cry` is not created until the method `say` is executed.
