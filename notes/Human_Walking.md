Human Walking
-------------

[BIO MOTION LAB](http://biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html)   
Just only 15 points. But looks like walking!

Curious about that. Tried to do on Shoes. :-D

Press `save` button, you can save 15 points' instance variables data as the part of Ruby code. That can be used as the instance variables again directly.

Look at [online demo](http://www.rin-shun.com/rubylearning/shoes/human_walking.swf.html).
